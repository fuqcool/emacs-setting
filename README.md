This is my emacs configuration.
Please feel free to do **anything** to this repo.

### Scripts

- `install.el` is used to install all the plugins through ELPA. One can invoke it using `emacs --scripts install.el`.

- `setup.bat|setup.sh` are used to link `.emacs` and `.emacs.d` to `~/.emacs` and `~/.emacs.d`, separately. Use only one of them: `bat` is for Windows, `sh` is for Linux and MacOS.
